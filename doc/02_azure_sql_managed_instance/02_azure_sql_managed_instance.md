===

## 07: Validate the configuration

1. [] Go back to your open **SQL Server Management Studio** window.

1. [] Replace your previous query for setting the master key with the following:

    ```
    -- Shows if the Always On availability groups feature is enabled
    SELECT SERVERPROPERTY ('IsHadrEnabled') as 'Always On enabled (1 true, 0 false)';
    GO
    -- Lists all trace flags enabled on SQL Server
    DBCC TRACESTATUS;
    ```

1. [] Select **Execute** on the top toolbar.

    !IMAGE[w29m4m3m.jpg](instructions286351/w29m4m3m.jpg)

    >[!note] **Always On enabled** should be **1**.

## Task 02: Configure network connectivity

## Introduction

Ensuring robust network connectivity is essential for Adatum Corporation to maintain high availability and disaster recovery for their eBook store, Adatum Books. To prevent disruptions to their eBook shopping services, they seek to implement a solution that ensures seamless network connectivity between their on-premises SQL VM and Azure SQL Managed Instance.

## Description

In this task, you'll configure network security settings, open required firewall ports, and test connectivity between SQL Server and the Azure SQL Managed Instance.

The Azure SQL Server VM is within the same virtual network as the targeted Managed Instance in this scenario.

## Success criteria

-   You configured the network security settings and opened the required firewall ports.
-   You tested and confirmed connectivity between SQL Server and the Azure SQL Managed Instance.
-   You ensured the Azure SQL Server VM is within the same virtual network as the targeted Managed Instance.

## Learning resources

-   Configure network security settings
-   [Test connectivity between SQL Server and the Azure SQL Managed Instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/connect/test-oledb-connectivity-use-udl-file)

***

**SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines**

For the link to work, you must have network connectivity between SQL Server and Managed Instance. The network option that you choose depends on whether or not your SQL Server instance is on an Azure network.

Deploying SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Azure virtual network that hosts SQL Managed Instance is the simplest method, because network connectivity will automatically exist between the two instances.

>   [!knowledge] For more information, see [Quickstart: Configure an Azure VM to connect to Azure SQL Managed Instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/connect-vm-instance-configure?view=azuresql).

***

**Different virtual network**

If your SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines instance is in a different virtual network from your managed instance, you need to make a connection between both virtual networks. The virtual networks don't have to be in the same subscription for this scenario to work.

There are two options for connecting virtual networks:

-   [Azure virtual network peering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview)
-   VNet-to-VNet VPN gateway ([Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal), [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps), [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-cli))

Peering is preferable because it uses the Microsoft backbone network, so from the connectivity perspective, there's no noticeable difference in latency between virtual machines in a peered virtual network and in the same virtual network.

Virtual network peering is supported between networks in the same region. Global virtual network peering is supported for instances hosted in subnets created after September 22, 2020.

>   [!knowledge] For more information, see [Frequently asked questions (FAQ)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/frequently-asked-questions-faq?view=azuresql#does-sql-managed-instance-support-global-vnet-peering).

***

**SQL Server outside Azure**

If your SQL Server instance is hosted outside Azure, establish a VPN connection between SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance by using either of these options:

-   [Site-to-site VPN connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-an-on-premises-network-to-a-microsoft-azure-virtual-network?view=o365-worldwide)
-   [Azure ExpressRoute connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction)

>   [!hint] ExpressRoute is recommended for the best network performance when you're replicating data. Provision a gateway with enough bandwidth for your use case.

===

## 01: Network ports between the environments

Regardless of the connectivity mechanism, there are requirements that must be met for the network traffic to flow between the environments. 

In this task, you'll open ports in Windows Firewall on the SQL VM, then configure ports on the Network Security Group (NSG) attached to the Managed Instance.

---

    # Outbound rule: Allow TCP port 5022 (any destination IP)
    New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow TCP port 5022 outbound" -Direction Outbound -Profile Any -Action Allow -LocalPort 5022 -Protocol TCP

    # Outbound rule: Allow TCP port range 11000-11999 (any destination IP)
    New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow TCP ports 11000-11999 outbound" -Direction Outbound -Profile Any -Action Allow -LocalPort 11000-11999 -Protocol TCP
    ```

    !IMAGE[9e03lkfr.jpg](instructions286351/9e03lkfr.jpg)

1. [] Select the minimize button on the VM's top control bar.

    !IMAGE[3nc97y5r.jpg](instructions286351/3nc97y5r.jpg)

>[!knowledge] #### Knowledge 
>- Ports need to be open in every firewall in the networking environment, including the host server, as well as any corporate firewalls or gateways on the network. In corporate environments, you might need to show your network administrator the information to help open additional ports in the networking layer.
>- While you can choose to customize the endpoint on the SQL Server side, the port numbers for a SQL Managed Instance cannot be changed or customized.
>- IP address ranges of subnets hosting Managed Instances and SQL Servers must not overlap.

===

## 02: Testing network connectivity using SSMS

Bidirectional network connectivity between SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance is necessary for the link to work. After you open ports on the SQL Server side and configure an NSG rule on the SQL Managed Instance side, you can test connectivity by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 

>[!knowledge] When you use **Network Checker** in SSMS, this automatically creates a temporary SQL Agent job on both SQL Server and the Managed Instance to check the connection. This job is then deleted after the test is finished. 
>
> You can alternatively use Transact-SQL, but you'd need to manually delete the SQL Agent job upon completion.

## 04: Transaction log backup

If SQL Server is your initial primary, it's important to take the first [transaction log backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/back-up-a-transaction-log-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16) on SQL Server after initial seeding completes, when the database is no longer in the **Restoring...** state on Azure SQL Managed Instance. 

You should take SQL Server transaction log backups regularly to minimize excessive log growth while SQL Server is in the primary role.

1. [] In **Object Explorer**, under **Databases**, right-click the **Adatum (Synchronized)** database, select **Tasks**, then select **Back Up...**.

1. [] In the new window, next to **Backup type**, select **Transaction Log** from the dropdown.

    !IMAGE[te5qxsb6.jpg](instructions286351/te5qxsb6.jpg)

# Conclusion

**Congratulations!** You've successfully migrated a SQL Server database to an Azure SQL Managed Instance.

---

In a real-world scenario, after you successfully complete theâ€¯migrationâ€¯stage, you should go through a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning efficiently.

This phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues, verifying completeness, and addressing performance issues with the workload.

For more details, review the [Post-migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-migration/sql-server/managed-instance/guide?view=azuresql#post-migration) section of the migration guide.
