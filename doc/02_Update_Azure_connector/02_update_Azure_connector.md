The **Type Text** feature used in this lab will send the specified text string to the active window in the virtual machine. Always compare the text in the lab document with the typed text in the virtual machine and verify that the expected text displays.

For larger code blocks, consider using the **Copy** button and then pasting the text by right-clicking or using **CTRL+V** in the virtual machine.

**Lab credentials**  
The credentials required for accessing the virtual environment and the lab-supplied Microsoft 365 tenant are available at the top of the instructions pane under the **Resources** tab. You can leverage the **Type Text** feature to automatically send the specified username and password to the active window in the virtual machine. Ensure that the credentials are entered correctly by comparing them with the values in the **Resources** tab.
