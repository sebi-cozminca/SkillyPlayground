## Introduction  

The City of Metropolis is dedicated to enhancing public services and administrative efficiency to meet the growing demands of its citizens. Faced with outdated document management systems and time-consuming administrative tasks, the city has embarked on a digital transformation journey. By migrating their on-premises PostgreSQL server to Azure Database for PostgreSQL, the City of Metropolis aims to streamline operations, improve data management, and deliver faster, more efficient public services.
