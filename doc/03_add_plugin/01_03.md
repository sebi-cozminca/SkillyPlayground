    > From the **Actions** page, you can access all the Power Platform connectors available in Copilot Studio to connect to a wide range of services. Many third-party connectors are available as well.   
    > 
    > You also have the option to **Add an API for a custom connector**. This allows you to provide the OpenAPI specification for an API to connect the declarative agent.

    > By default, the action uses **Dynamically fill with best option**, which allows the orchestrator engine to extract information from the prompt and automatically fill these parameters.
