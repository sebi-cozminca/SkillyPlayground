# Exercise 03: Add a Microsoft 365 Copilot plugin to a declarative agent

Now that we have the declarative agent up and running, we'll see how to expand its capabilities by adding actions through Power Platform connectors available in **Copilot Studio**. 

 
The outcome of this exercise is the successful creation of a new action within the declarative agent that interacts with external services. In this case, we'll use **Microsoft To-Do**. 

 
Declarative agents are the primary way to extend the capabilities of Copilot, and plugins always run within the context of an agent. By adding plugins, you enable the agent to connect to external platforms and perform a wide variety of actions. We'll take a response from Copilot and use the information it retrieves to create a new task in our To-Do list.
